	<p>  
	  The FAR-78-1 Gundam, called the 'Far Gundam" stamds for Full-Armor-Revised Gundam and was developed in U.C 0080. As the name implies, 
      this is a revised variant of the FA-78-1 Gundam developed during the One Year War. This mobile suit is based on the RX-70 G Ground Gundam 
      but incorpates a new torse, with a 360-monitor cockpit, a new head with highly-accurate sensors, and a new backpack with a 0.45 shoulder cannon 
      and a anti-missle rocket launcher pod. Also, this mobile suit uses a new alloy called gundarium platnium and is built into the mobile suit 
	  instead being on top of the already exsiting mobile suit like the original FA-78-1 Gundam. 
	  This is an effort to increase mobility and agility which did in its testing. 
	  Its weaponary consists a X.B.Sa-G-03 Beam Saber, YHI YF-MG100 100mm Machine Gun, BLASH XBR-M-79E Beam Rifle, 
	  RGM*S-Sh-WF/S-00109 Shield, a 0.45 shoulder cannon, and a anti-missle rocket launcher pod. This Gundam was built and dveloped in December of U.C. 0080 and is now being deployed near Side 7. 
	  The test pilot is First Lietunant Heinz Baer and will give the mobile suit's report on July 31st.
