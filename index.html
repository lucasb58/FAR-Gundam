    <title> FAR-78-1 Gundam U.C. 0080 </title>  
	<!-- I choose this title for a couple reasons. One is it is short, does not exceed 66 characters, and 
	the less words there are in your title tag, the more value Google attributes to each word according to AG Consult. 
	My title accurately describes what my webpage is, that being a fictional Gundam in U.C. 0080inspired by the Mobile Suit Gundam franchise
	But most importantly it contains the word "Gundam" in the first 11 eleven characters in the title which can increase the clickability of this 
	webpage accordign to a study called "First 2 Words: A Signal for the Scanning Eye" by Jakob Nielsen-->

	<p>  
	The FAR-78-1 Gundam, called the 'Far Gundam" stamds for Full-Armor-Revised Gundam and was developed in U.C 0080. As the name implies, 
	this is a revised variant of the FA-78-1 Gundam developed during the One Year War. This mobile suit is based on the RX-70 G Ground Gundam 
	but incorpates a new torse, with a 360-monitor cockpit, a new head with highly-accurate sensors, and a new backpack with a 0.45 shoulder cannon 
	and a anti-missle rocket launcher pod. Also, this mobile suit uses a new alloy called gundarium platnium and is built into the mobile suit 
	instead being on top of the already exsiting mobile suit like the original FA-78-1 Gundam. 
	This is an effort to increase mobility and agility which did in its testing. 
	Its weaponary consists a X.B.Sa-G-03 Beam Saber, YHI YF-MG100 100mm Machine Gun, BLASH XBR-M-79E Beam Rifle, 
	RGM*S-Sh-WF/S-00109 Shield, a 0.45 shoulder cannon, and a anti-missle rocket launcher pod. This Gundam was built and dveloped in December of U.C. 0080 and is now being deployed near Side 7. 
	The test pilot is First Lietunant Heinz Baer and will give the mobile suit's report on July 31st.
